# An ongoing personal site project
This express server started out as a full-time webserver, tossing up my static pages and dealing with api calls and other bogus.  Now that I've got apache up on the pine, I can let that do the heavy lifting and use this little app, and lots of npm modules, to deal with apis.
### TODO
- [x] serve static content
- [x] figure out how to use darksky api (thanks to a neat [wrapper](https://github.com/soplakanets/node-forecastio))
- [x] implement client-side use of weather.json route
- [ ] more interactive design using the Dark Sky data
- [ ] maybe one day figure out HTTPS
- [ ] more things!
- [ ] use this just as a web app relay
